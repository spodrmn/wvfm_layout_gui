Download both the app file (as a .py file) and the logo (as a .png file) in the same folder. 

To create the app:
Before running your script, set your API key as an environment variable:

On macOS/Linux:

export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

On Windows (Command Prompt):

set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

On Windows (PowerShell):

$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

This is useful for testing. It will only persist while that terminal window is open. Alternatively you can set it on the system level.
